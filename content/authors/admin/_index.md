<div style="text-align: justify">

My research focuses on the evolution of sociality in lizards with a particular interest in the role of kin recognition. Specifically, I am interested in the role of kin recognition itself, its importance in the early evolution of sociality and how it becomes refined as social systems become increasingly complex. While I am based at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Hobart ([BEER group](https://beergrouputas.wordpress.com/)), my field and experimental work takes place at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/) in Sydney ([Lizardlab](https://whitinglab.com/)).

Before moving to Australia I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/), Belgium. During this time I studied animal personalities in birds for my Master's thesis and took part in a project on urbanisation and island effects in lizards.
