#     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

My research focuses on the evolution of sociality in lizards with a particular interest in the role of kin recognition. Specifically, I am interested in the role of kin recognition itself, its importance in the early evolution of sociality and how it becomes refined as social systems become increasingly complex. While I am based at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Hobart ([BEER group](https://beergrouputas.wordpress.com/)), my field and experimental work takes place at the [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/) in Sydney ([Lizardlab](https://whitinglab.com/)).

Before moving to Australia I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/), Belgium. During this time I studied animal personalities in birds for my Master's thesis and took part in a project on urbanisation and island effects in lizards.
