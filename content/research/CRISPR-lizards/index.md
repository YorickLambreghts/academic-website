## Why genetic modification?


## Study system

We are currently focussing on three lizard species, selected based on availability of their genome and useful reproductive traits. The first is the Asian house gecko, _Hemidactylus frenatus_. This species is originally from Southeast Asia and is invasive in Australia. This species is great for this research because the females can consistently produce two eggs every few weeks. The second species is the garden skinks, _Lampropholis delicata_. This species is found in high abundance in Sydney. Like the gecko, _L. delicata_ can breed multiple times per year under the right housing conditions. The third species is the central bearded dragon, _Pogona vitticeps_. This is a medium sized lizards with a well-studied genome. In addition, females can produce up to 30 eggs at a time.
