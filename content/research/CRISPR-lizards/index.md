## Why genetic modification?


## Study system

We are currently focussing on two small lizard species that can be commonly found throughout Sydney, Australia. The first is the Asian house gecko, _Hemidactylus frenatus_. This is an invasive species with year-round reproduction. This last trait . The second species is the garden skinks, _Lampropholis delicata_. This species is native to Sydney and surroundings where it is found in high abundance. Like the gecko, _L. delicata_ can breed multiple times per year under the right housing conditions. These two species were choosen because (i) they are both capable of breeding multiple times throughout the year -- which is important because it allows for experiments all year round, rather than be restricted to one annual reproductive event -- and (ii) we have mostly complete full genomes for each species, which we need to be able to target the specific gene sequences.

At a later stage, we will expand our procedures to additional species such as _Pogona vitticeps_, _Liopholis whitii_ and _Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii_.
