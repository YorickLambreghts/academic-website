Kin recognition, the ability to identify genetic relatives, relies on familiarisation for the creation of recognition templates. During development, parent and embryo(s) are exposed to chemical, auditory, and tactile cues that can communicate reliable genetic information. We discuss how these cues can have organisational effects during a time of heightened phenotypic sensitivity, creating postnatal kin preferences. As familiarisation is often determined by the prenatal social environment, we argue that reproductive traits that alter the social context of the prenatal environment, such as reproductive mode, could facilitate the evolution of kin recognition. Furthermore, we outline how these effects of prenatal familiarisation can extend beyond kin recognition and play a pivotal role in the emergence and evolution of complex social behaviours.
